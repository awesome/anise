summary: A Dynamic Annotation System for Ruby
description: ! 'Anise is an Annotation System for the Ruby programming language.

  Unlike most other annotations systems it is not a comment-based or

  macro-based system that sits over-and-above the rest of the code.

  Rather, Anise is a dynamic annotations system operating at runtime.'
