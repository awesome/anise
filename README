= Anise

   http://anise.rubyforge.org


== INTRODUCTION

Anise is an Annotations Systems for the Ruby programming language.
Unlike most other annotations systems it is not a comment-based
system, or a "macro" system that sits over-and-above the rest of the 
code. Rather, Anise is a dynamic annotations system operating at runtime.

Anise is a spin off of the old Facets annotations.rb library.
It includes the Annotations functionality, and adds a mixin,
Annotator, that makes it easy to add new annotations on the fly.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see the RELEASE file.


== INSTALLATION

To install with RubyGems simply open a console and type:

   gem install anise

To manually install you will need Setup.rb (see http://setup.rubyforge.org).
Then download the tarball package and do:

   $ tar -xvzf anise-0.2.0.tgz
   $ cd anise-0.2.0
   $ sudo setup.rb all


== USAGE

The following example briefly demonstrates all three major features.

   require 'anise'

   class X

     include Anise

     # Annotations

     ann :grape, :class=>String

     # Annotators

     annotator :doc

     doc "This is an entry."

     def bar
       # ...
     end

     # Annotated Attributes

     attr :baz, Integer, :max => 10

   end

Looking at the resulting annotations:

   X.ann(:foo)  #=> {:class=>String}
   X.ann(:bar)  #=> {:doc=>"This is an entry."}
   X.ann(:baz)  #=> {:class=>Integer, :max=>10}

The Anise library can be used as a whole, per the example above, or these
features can be used separately. For more details see the RDoc API
documentation.


== TESTING

Turn is the recommended way to run Anise's test suite (http://turn.rubyforge.org).

  $ turn test/test_*

But a script +test/suite.rb+ script is include so you can easily run
the unit tests with the testrb command:

  $ testrb -Ilib test/suite.rb

or with Ruby alone:

  $ ruby -Ilib -rtest/unit test/suite.rb

Anise also includes Quarry specifications. These can be run via:

  $ quarry -v spec/

See Quarry project (http://quarry.rubyforge.org) for more informaiton.
